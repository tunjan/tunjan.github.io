- Time: don't forget that someday death will come, and all you have done will count for nothing.
- Compassion: do onto others as you would have them do unto you.
- Learning: the body decays after a certain age. The mind (hopefuly) only grows until the end.
- Curiosity: learn to understand why things are the way they are.
- Reflection: re-value the actions you took in the past to learn from them.
- Simplicity: avoid unnecesary complexity.
- Humility: be willing to learn from others and accept your shortcomings.
- Humanity: the acceptance that I am a homo sapiens, and as such I have limits and needs. Those needs have to be satisfied for the enhancement of my existance and to increase the worth of my life. (i.e: friendship, love, socialization, nutrition).
- Hopefulness: to learn to not give up and be defeated on things worth achieving. Friendship, equality, freedom, justice. And to know that even if I have failed everytime it does not mean that I will fail the next.
- Skepticism: always inspect one layer down into the nature of things. Don't take things at face value with the easiest explanation.
- Equality: all humans and non-human animals deserve to have the same consideration of interests based on their ability to consciously experience life.
- Politics: that modern society opinions are mostly influenced by the interest of capitalism.

# Tunjan is a human being

Tunjan is the pseudonym I have employed with the aim to keep egotism at bay.

It would certainly be nice to have a good description of his entity in written form. But I find no words to describe it, introductions feel too limiting and restrictive, and I feel like an impostor if I do not behave in accordance to it.
His views change with time, and today he might not be the same as yesterday. That is why the page <a href=now.html>Recent</a> shows what he is up to as a way of knowing him better.

<!-- He is currently exploring new ways of living, challenging modern society values and building skills to contribute to ethical projects.  -->

He likes to rethink the values imposed by capitalism. Spend time doing mental experiments. Scape the confort zone. Learn languages. Developing creativity. Writing a journal. And generally, trying new things he sucks at. He loves sucking at things, because then, he can learn.

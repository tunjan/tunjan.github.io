<q>There are two ways of constructing a [software](/src/software.html) design: One way is
to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
deficiencies.</q>

## Unix philosophy

1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
2. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.
3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

# How I live

  Notes on my lifestyle and principles I apply.

## Nutrition

  Not long since adopting a vegan diet, I noticed much more sustained levels of energy and increased lean body mass. 
  Thus, I have aligned my food intake with nature, only eating as much as suffices my body for good health, and consuming everything from fresh produce.
  The decision regarding transitioning into a vegan diet has to do mainly with morality insights after watching [Dominion](watchdominion.org) and the desire to avoid
  harmful actions.

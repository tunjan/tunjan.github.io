## Nutrition

  Not long since adopting a [vegan](/src/nutrition.html) diet, I noticed much more sustained levels of energy and increased lean body mass, I felt my body working as an interrelated organism which given the right amounts and type of fuel, performs at the highest level. No more bloating after a meal, no sleepiness after lunch. 
  Thus, I have aligned my food intake with nature demands, only eating as much as suffices my body for good health, and consuming from fresh produce when available

  The decision regarding transitioning into a veganism has to do mainly with moral insights after watching [Dominion](https://watchdominion.org), and the desire to avoid [harmful actions](/src/philosophy.html).

## Materialism

Learning to live with less is one of the principles guiding my decisions in life. Reflecting, after being away from home, on the number of things I owned,
it became obvious that the more things I had the more things I needed. And in turn, the less time I had to reflect on substantial matters of life. The realization was that by consuming, one learns to avoid the pain of thinking deep thoughts, so the mind is always occupied with looking for the next product or expecting the next advertisement to capture one's attention. While generating a necessity to earn more capital and keep wasting time.

<q>A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone</q>
<cite>Henry David Thoreau, Walden</cite>

## Sociality

Meditation revealed to me how compulsive and unfulfilling my daily life was. Days spent waiting for a reply to come, for an update to check, for meaning which never manifested. So I decided to take the course of abstaining from consumer culture, social media and seeking the approbation of others. Instead, I decided to engage in more meaningful endeavors and living a more deliberate life. No longer using the phone mindlessly, restricting its use for anything other than phone calls and modern 'necessities'. All this changes translated into having more time, which at the start made my days feel empty. However, soon enough I found other meaningful activities to engage on. Often the meetings consist of cooking a new recipe, discussing ethical concerns, and playing card games.

<q>Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them</q>

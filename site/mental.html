        <h1>Knowledge derived from &quot;You are not a Rock&quot; by Mark Freeman</h1>
<p>Guide your actions through values, not on feelings to avoid or pursue.</p>
<h2>Not your mind</h2>
<p>Most of our lives spring from reactions to thoughts that come to our minds.
However, it is important to realize that it is not possible to control the
thoughts that the mind creates, as it is an independent entity. Then, it follows
that trying to control its behaviour is utterly useless and that we should not
blindlessly follow its choices. What must we do then? Accept the thoughts as
internal experience; as you feel pain, as you feel pleasure. And then, act
according to your values.</p>
<p><em> — A disturbing thought came upon me! It tells me to rethink a conversation
I just had, then it tells me to re-listen an audio message I sent. And now to
judge people based on its clothes.<br></p>
<p>— It is obvious that your mind wants to do those things. After all, you have
trained it all your life to do so. But now you have the choice, you have become
empowered. Will you chase after her, or invest your time wisely?.</em></p>
<p>It is yours the decision to engage in compulsions to avoid feelings of boredom,
anxiety, uncertainty and impatience. Nonetheless, it is yours too, to accept
(not trying to suppress) those feelings which the mind generates to protect you,
and commit to actions which spring from wisely selected values and beliefs.
Briefly stated, to achieve freedom from the slavery of the mind.</p>
<p>PD: It must be noted, that meditation is a critical practice which allows one to
become an adept at recognizing the thoughts and distractions the mind throws at
us, viewing them with curiosity. After all, it's the mind, not you.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p><q>You can pour the rest of your life into trying not to be anxious and trying
to prevent your worries from coming true, and all you'll have done is focused
your energy on things that didn't even happen and you didn't even want to think
about</q></p>
<p><q>If you hand over control of your value to others, expect them to waste it.
They won't know you've put them in charge of the only thing you own.</q></p>
<p><q>When you are caught up in the practice of mindlessness, death becomes very
frightening because you are actually aware of moving close and closer to the end
of the life you could have had</q></p>
<p><q>The more you control, the more you must control</q></p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental health</strong> : learning to handle feelings you do not like, while taking
action in alignment with your values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compulsion</strong> : anything you do to cope with, check on, or control
uncertainty, anxiety and other feelings you don't like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mindfulness</strong> : the awareness that arises through paying attention on
purpose in the present moment-non-judgmentally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlling</strong> : trying to prevent experiences we do not like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACT</strong> : <em>Accept</em> your reactions and be present. <em>Choose</em> a valued direction.
<em>Take</em> action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive diffusion</strong> : therapy to recognize the stuff in your head is stuff
you experience. Not you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Meditations</h2>
<p>The mind can pay attention at one thing at a time. Choose that 'one thing'
wisely.</p>
<p>Meditation, to experience thoughts <strong>without judgment</strong> or
attachment, but curiosity.</p>
<p>Worse mental health investing your time into non-valuable things.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: How would I define myself based on the actions done today?</p>
<p>Compulsions arise good feelings, teaching brain feel bad to feel good.</p>
<p>Actions, separate from thoughts and emotions, act according to values while
experiencing thoughts.</p>
<p>Checking compulsions train your brain to find more uncertainties.</p>
<p>If needed to check to feel safe. A <strong>prerequisite</strong> for feeling
safe is feeling unsafe.</p>
<p>Do not stop using X to avoid compulsions, use it as you would like to use it.</p>
<p>You do not have to answer every preoccupation the brain throws at you.</p>
<p>If you are present while doing things, the necessity to check disappears.</p>
<p>Your brain might throw thoughts or judgements to you, recognize that and act as
you value. Your thoughts are not you, you cannot control them.</p>
<p>Introduce <strong>fantasy</strong> elements in your thoughts to be aware of their discrepancy
with reality.</p>
<p>It is normal to experience physical symptoms after withdrawing from a
compulsion.</p>
<p>When living life based off your values, there is a constant need to ask
constantly how you are <strong>creating your life</strong>.</p>
<p>When making decisions regarding values, the benefits of saying no become much
clearer.</p>
<p>Dress as an expression of myself, not as an attempt to avoid fears or control
over other people. (we identify by what we buy)</p>
<p>You may see your past as happy, but remember that your past habits are what lead
you to this point.</p>
<p>It is not that you do not have time, but that you spend it on things you do not
care about deeply.</p>
<p>Practice non-judgement; learn to judge when you want to, not when the mind tells
you.</p>
<p>Notice the judgments your mind creates; are they based in evidence? are they
true?</p>
<p>Happiness practice; actions that make you happy in the long term, not now.</p>
<p>Functioning; do what matters to you, whatever you are feeling.</p>
<p>Cultivating happiness is a practice. Through gratitude. At any moment.</p>
<p>Obsessions and fears are not true; only in your mind.</p>
<p>Embrace uncertainties, love them. Do not chase after them.</p>
<p>Experience your thoughts, cut compulsions, change systems, act on values.</p>
<p>Mental health; the same as physical fitness.</p>
<p>Barriers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Believing you are unique</li>
<li>Trying to get understanding</li>
<li>Systems of compulsions not dismantled</li>
<li>Avoiding relapse</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone faces similar mental health challenges. We are humans.</p>

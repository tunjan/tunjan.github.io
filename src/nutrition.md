# Principles

  - Do not eat anything your great-grandmother would not know existed.
  - Eat the most colorful ones.
  - Eat as many colors as possible.
  - Eat only as much as suffices for hunger & good health. 
  - Aim to fast for 12 hours each day.

# Meal planning

  Best method is to think in advance what you are going to eat for the next 5 days,
  and buy just enough to avoid wasting food. This is most necesary for vegetables, as they perish quicker than other edibles.
  Look for vegan recipes in resources aimed toward budget meals. You'll save some money and time looking for extravagant and imported provisions.
  * Remember to place here my meal plan (or make it now?).

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
<p>Not long since adopting a vegan diet, I noticed much more sustained levels of energy and increased lean body mass, I felt my body working as an interrelated organism which given the right amounts and type of fuel, performs at the highest level. 
Thus, I have aligned my food intake with nature demands, only eating as much as suffices my body for good health, and consuming everything from fresh produce. Also, avoid purchasing food which comes in plastic bags unless there is no other choice.</p>
<p>The decision regarding transitioning into a vegan diet has to do mainly with moral insights after watching <a href="https://watchdominion.org">Dominion</a>, and the desire to avoid <a href="/src/philosophy.html">harmful actions</a>. This realization could be said to have ended my blind pursuit of societal norms, and to become a more informed and critical individual about societal matters.</p>
<h2>Materialism</h2>
<p>Learning to live with less is one of the principles guiding my decisions in life. Reflecting on the number of things I owned after being away from home,
I became aware that the more things I had the more things I needed. And in turn, the less time I had to reflect on substantial matters of life. The realization was that by consuming, one learns to avoid the pain of thinking deep thoughts, so the mind is always occupied with looking for the next product or expecting the next adverstisement to capture one's attention.</p>
<p><q>A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone</q>
<cite>Henry David Thoreau, Walden</cite></p>
<h2>Sociality</h2>
<p>Meditation revealed to me how compulsive and unfulfiling my daily life was. Days spent waiting for a reply to come, for an update to check, for meaning which never manifested. So I decided to take the course of abstaining from social media and seeking the approbation of others. Instead, I decided to engage in more meainingful endeavours and living a more deliberate life. I no longer use the phone for anyhthing other than phone calls, by which I meet with meaningful relatives. Often the meetings consist of cooking a new recipe, discussing ethical concerns, and playing card games.</p>

# Third person experiment

Tunjan is the pseudonym I have employed with the aim to keep egotism at bay.

It would certainly be nice to have a good description of their entity in written form. But I find no words to describe them, introductions feel too limiting and restrictive, and I feel like an impostor if I do not behave in accordance to them.
Their views and goals change as time goes, and today they might differ greatly from yesterday. That is why the page <a href=now.html>Recent</a> shows what he is up to as a way of knowing them better.

<!-- He is currently exploring new ways of living, challenging modern society values and building skills to contribute to ethical projects.  -->

They like to reconsider values imposed by capitalism. Spend time doing mental experiments. Scape the confort zone. Learn languages. Develop creativity. Write a journal. Find ways to save energy. And generally, trying new things they suck at. Because then, they can learn.

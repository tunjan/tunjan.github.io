        <h2>Moldova (17/08/2022)</h2>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>0800</p>
<p>Woke up in Ionika hostel after arriving last night at 0230. The hostel had two floors, with two showers and one bathroom in each floor.
I was assigned one top bed in a room with 10 more people, some of them were snoring. However, I was foresighted enough to have brought some earplugs and a mask.
The backpack I brought was too large to be put inside a locker, so I carried it into the bed with me, then had a shower, then went to sleep.
This morning I had a talk with a Moldovan, whose fathers emigrated to Italy while he preferred to stay here.</p>
<p>1230</p>
<p>Went to withdraw some cash from an ATM while waiting for Vladimir to arrive and pick me up. When he arrived, we went inside a taxi and he gave me a SIM card. I tried to unlock it with the password that was in the card, but the phone got locked and I was being asked to insert the PUK, which, obviously didn't know. After thinking for a while I noticed that the PIN of the SIM card was wrong because I was inserting the one from my normal SIM card. Thus, I removed the old SIM card and left only the new one from Moldova. It worked, although it had not any money to work. Vladimir went to charge it with 60 MDL and that gave me 150 minutes of call and 10 GiB of data. I was actually scared when my SIM got locked, for I did not have the key needed to open the SIM card slot and couldn't use my phone because it was locked. Maybe they had trapped me, or so I thought. It never ended up happening.</p>
<p>1400</p>
<p>The taxi driver took us to the supermarket where we met with Ira, the shelter owner. She seems to be old, yet it feels when you talk to her that you are the same age, which is something I never felt before. It maybe due to the language we speak, which is English and none of us are natives. Then, we went to the supermarket, bought fruits, bread, cereals, and legumes for me to eat at the shelter. The prices were lower than in Spain. Yet it seems to me that for locals it is a high price. Vladimir left and I went with Ira to the shelter. He asked me if I left a tip to the receptionist for helping me check in at those hours of the night. I told him I did not and so added 40 more MDL to the 60 for charging the SIM card. However, he did not give it to the receptionist because it might seem to be like an offense. Maybe they are Moldovan customs.</p>
<p>1430</p>
<p>Ira and I left for the shelter. The driver did not speak English as it is mostly the case with everyone here. In the way there, Ira told me she studied computer science, but could not find a job after graduating because the language she knew (Pascal and C) where not used by big companies anymore, I found it depressing, although some part of me feels like she didn't look far or deep enough. One must be hard-headed nowadays to not find a job with a computer science bachelor completed.</p>
<p>When arriving at the shelter I was actually amazed at the nature there was there. It looked liked a jungle. Soon my wishes were broken, for what was after the 'jungle' was actually an inferno, or so you might say. Dogs barking to you each step you made. The kitchen was a total mess. Bits of food left in the drawers, everything filled with flies (due to the immense quantity of meat they boil) not even a clean towel to dry your hands. I had my fruit set up in a section of the fridge. Interestingly there were no fruits in the fridge, which means none of them eat fruit.</p>
<p>My main task here is to spend time with the dogs, give them a walk and take photos of them so someone adopts them. The cabin I reside in has a terrace and two bedrooms. One of them is for the puppies, the other for me. I was hoping to meet Renan, but he left to Hungary before I arrived. In the cabin, as I said reside a few puppies too (7 puppies 2 little dogs). Outside of it there are other 5 dogs, one of them blind. And they puppies cannot get in touch with the older dogs. All the place is organized so dogs share their lives with the same dogs in a sections until they die. If they mix with other dog's sections they start killing each other. Those who do not fit in any place are left in an isolated place. Such as the bathroom.</p>
<p>There is an intense odor to dead animal here, which permeates everything, even my room. It is due to the way they (the workers) feed the dogs. Their method being gathering leftovers from dead animals in the city (mostly pigs and chicken) and bringing them here thereafter. The owner's grandmother then boils the dead animals body parts in giant pots of water and feeds the whole shelter with those. One of my tasks today was to carry buckets filled with that liquid to the dog places. I don't find many things disgusting in these life. Cockroaches look fine to me and so dead animals do not harm my eyes. But this smell is not something which the human being is born to suffer. Not only for its unnedeenes but for the mess it makes. How easy would it be to leave this dogs feed on their own, in a environment which encourages every being to live.</p>
<p>The perplexity which the shelter owned looked at me after asking why they saved so many dogs but no pigs and cows, shows me the fault of reasoning in most of this country. And that being the response of the most educated (academically) person I have met here yet.</p>
<p>Another task I did was spending some time with a few puppies playing together. It was interesting to see there was a lonely one. Who appeared to be in fear of me, but not long after I realized it was from other puppies he was afraid. How is not he to be afraid of others. I would be afraid of life if destined to live inside a cage with my own bullies. Which sometimes is our own mind.</p>
<p>Each time I went to touch him he run scared. After a while he became used to me, and suddenly approached my legs. But while I was in the way of touching him, his bullies became jealous and started biting and punching him. Which in my experience relates very well into human nature. After all we are not very different. It might be by observing a dog that I observe myself. And by observing dogs I observe society.</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Once in the shelter (which is 30 minutes away from Chisinau city). I changed into work clothes</p>

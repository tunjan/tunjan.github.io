# Volunteering in Animal Shelter

In the summer of 2022, 32 days were spent doing a volunteering in Moldova.
This is an account of the journey, which I dare say to have enjoyed despite the circumstances.
Which by many are said to have been too dangerous as to adventure into travel. Nonetheless, I did not wish
to be coerced by fear, as most civilized society is kept to-day.

## Where I lived & How I lived

It must be said, in spite of the loss of audacity. That it was not in my interest to go into such a place
which had a war recently started by a neighbour country. However, given the circumstances in which I found
myself to be at the time of decision. Moldova offered me the easiest approval to initiate an adventure.

If I had not found myself discontented with my current life-style, and feeling that it was not life that I was living.
It would be dubious? for me to have undertaken such a manner to eradicate the means by which I used to sustain.
Thus, I owe to Thoreau, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius the courage and wisdom they passed to me by as many words as endeavors 
they took during their own lifetimes.

Many close affairs of mine have taken the trouble to warn against the possible outcomes of this journey, though
they did not understand that it was their own outcome which I desired to avoid. To live a life of simplicity, solitude and
meagerness was a experiment that I should try. And then conclude if all the luxury which people pursue and toil their hands for,
mindlessly filling their busy lives was worth the trouble to get. For I do not mean to work more than I should, and even less
for the wrong kind of pursuit, as it seems that most of my neighbours do.

To find pleasure and meaning in the coarsest things of existence was a pleasure in itself. I did not find myself in need of a shower
unless my armpits had tears in it. And when I did cold water was there to remember the focus on breathing. 
Three t-shirts for a whole month sufficed me as much as one. For one does not need what one does not have. 
Or am I so fool as to forget what I have while seeking what is not mine?.

## The forest

Every morning I was compelled to enjoy nature, and so took my legs and thoughts to the forest. How best to spare the
best hours of the day? Nay, the best of existence itself. Being in bed was a waste of time to me when I could be listening
and observing how spiders and birds went by their usual affairs, which I dare say to be much more interesting than of us humans.
The wild take only the present and enjoy it to its fullest, while us humans spend most of our present tither and hither, 
fearing the future, loathing the past.
It is said that we, _homo sapiens_ are above all species, due to our ability of reason. Though I have met a few who developed it enough
to be above spiders. That is why it is called ability, because you are _able to_ not because you are born with it.

At meal time everyone eats their portion without giving a thought to the means by which it was obtained or cooked,
because they did not engage in the act itself. Oh, how few people would go through the trouble of eating meat if they
were aware of the many flies they attract when dead.



Not one day had the
forest the same colour and sounds as any other.

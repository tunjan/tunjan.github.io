# Tunjan is a human being

Tunjan is the pseudonym I have employed with the aim to keep egotism at bay.
He is currently exploring new ways of living, challenging modern society values and building skills to contribute to ethical projects. 

Most of his life has been experienced through the simulation of reality provided by consumer media, endless hours spent in video games and pointless tasks. Now he has made up his mind to live deliberately and learn from life what it has to teach him. And not when he comes to die, discover that he has not lived.

Lately he has been interested in Greek philosophy, web development and volunteering.

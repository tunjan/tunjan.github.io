# Guidelines on reading to understand.

Reading — for understanding, not information — is an **active** commitment from the reader to have a **conversation** with the writer.
The reader should ask as many **questions** as possible, in an orderly manner, with the goal of achieving the same level
of **understanding** as the author. So as to be able to argue and critize him.

## Demanding reader

The demanding reader asks questions while he reads, and tries to **answer** them precisely and accurately.
There are four questions that must be asked of any worthwhile book, these are **obligations** to the reader.
Once they are answered, the analytical reading is complete.

  1. What is the book as a **whole**?
  2. What is being said in detail and how?
  3. Is the book true, in whole or in part?
  4. What of it?

The worst fault of the non-demandng reader is his inatenttion to **words**, and failure to **come to terms** with the author.

## Levels of reading

 The higher the level, the more effort is required. Higher levels require mastery of the lowers.

 1. **Elementary**: Understanding words and sentences.
 2. **Inspectional**: Know the surface of a book thorugh systematical skimming. 
 3. **Analytical**: Chew and digest the book by asking as many organized questions as possible.  
 4. **Syntopical**: Reading many books of the same subject and placing them in relation to one another.

## Inspectional

Tells you whether it is **worth** giving the book an analytical reading.
If you decide to give it up, you will have learnt a lot from it.
If you decide to continue into analytical reading, it will allow to **answer** many questions.

<q>Some books are to be tasted,
others to be swallowed,
and some to be chewed and digested</q>

### Questions
   
Structure, not substance.

- What kind of book is it?
- What is the book about as a whole?
- What is the structure of the book?

### Steps

+ Pre-reading:

  Main theme or idea.

  1. Look the **title** & **preface**.
  2. Study **table of contents** .
  3. Check **index**. Read passages with crucial terms. Estimate topics covered.
  4. Read **publisher's blurb** and decide if worth to read.
  5. Find pivotal **chapters** to the arguments. Read chapters summaries carefully.
  6. Turn to **random** pages, reading a paragraph or two. Read the last two or three pages.

+ Superficial reading: 

  - Read it the first time **without stopping** on look-ups or pondering on things.
  - Concentrate on things you can understand
  - Take notes.

<q>Do not try to understand every word or page of a difficult book the first time through.
This is the most imporant rule of all; it is the essence of inspectional reading. Do not be afraid
to be, or seem to be, superficial. Race through even the hardest book. You will then be prepared
to read it well the second time.</q>

Method to read for understanding.

### Rules

<q>To forget the acts as separate, you have to learn them first as separate acts.</q>

#### First stage

Outlining the structure

1. **Classify** the book according to kind and [subject](reading.html#classification) matter.
2. State what the whole book is **about** with the utmost brevity.
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. <details><summary>More</summary>
Set forth the major parts of the book, and how these are organized into a whole by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole. 
Find the plan behing the book. The best books have the most intelegible structure, but are more complex. Outline the parts of a book and how they exemplify the main theme.
(1) The author accomplished his plan in five major parts pf whih the first is so and so, the second about such and such... The first major part is divided in three sections of which the first considers X the second Y and the third Z. In the first section of the firt part the author makes four points. The first is A, the second B...
Only needed an aproximation of this. And does not need to be done explicitly, but while reading the book if you are experienced. Only appply this rule very well with few books. With others a rough notion is fine. No book deserves a perfect outline. Basically divide the book in parts and the</details>
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.<details><summary>More</summary>You should be able to state the main questions that the book tries to answer, and divide it into subquestions if the first is too complex.</details>

#### Second stage

Interpreting the contents

5. Come to terms with the author.<details>Determine the meaning of important words. The ones that give you trouble. That the author tell you how they use it. Important to mark them. Look at the same wods in different contexts to understand it. IN good books terms are well defined </details>
6. Find the relevant propositions in key sentences.<details><summary>More</summary>Those that require an effort of interpretation. The major affirmations and denials and the reasons are the heart. Ask questions about the meaning of a passage. Most important sentences have important words. One sentence may have more than one proposition. State the propositions in your own words. Explain what the author means by a particular sentence. If you cannot express them with other words, only words have passed from author to reader. If you say you know what an author means but can only repeat his sentence, then you know nothing.</details>

7. Locate or construct the basic arguments of the author from sentences.<details><summary>More</summary>find the paragraphs that state the important arguments ubt if the arguments are not epressed, construct them by taking a sentece from each paragraph. Write on paper the propositions. Put numbers in the margins. Normal is two arguments in a paragraph. Propaganda leaves things unsaid that should be made explicit but not becasue they might be challenged. Any good argument can be put in a nutshell. Every argument involves a number of statements. Look for assumptinos or self-evident facts</details>

8. Discern problem the author has or has not solved. <details><summary>More</summary>State what problems the author failed to solve.</details>

### Third Stage

Critizing book as a communication of knowledge.

Now the reader talks back to the author. Reading does not end with understanding what the book says. It must be completed by the work of criticism the work of judging. A good book is not above the criticism of the average reader. The most teachable reader is the most critical. He responds to a book with the greatest effort to make his own mind on the matters the author has discussed. To regard anyone except yourself as responsible for your judgment is to be a slave.

9. Understand the author before critizing. <details><summary>More</summary>To critize is not limited to disagreeing. Understanding means you can state the author position in your own words. If you do not understand good books it is your fault.</details>

10. Do not be disputateous or [contentious](quotes.html#contentiousness) disagreeing. <details><summary>More</summary>He who regards a conversation as a battle can win only by being an antagonist. Be as prepared to agree as to disagree with the author. The main objective is reaching the truth together.</details>

11. Give logical reasons for critical judgment.<details><summary>More</summary>Distinguish between reasoned knowledge and expression of opinion. Knowledge are opininos that can be defended. Opinion is unsupported judgment. Acknowledge emotions, we are animals. Make your assumptions explicit. Attempt impartiality. Sine qua non. Critics: (1) You are uninformed, state the knowledge that the author lacks and show how it is relevant, how it makes a difference to conclusions. (2) You are misinformed, only if releveant to author conclusions. (3) You are ilogical (4) Your analysis is incomplete, author not solved all the problems he started with, he has not made good use of his materials, he did not see all the implications o ramifications he ha failed to make distinctions relevant. Be definite about these remarks and give reasons. If you cannot say that the author is uninformed, misinformed or illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. You must agree. Suspended judgement on the reader's part responds to an author's failure to solve his problems perfectly. - Show where in the author is uninformed (disagreement).- Show wherein the author is misinformed (disagreement). - Show wherein the author is illosgical (disagreement). - Show wherein the author's analysis is incomplete. (suspend judgment)
</details>



### Questions to ask

1. What is the book as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?

## Reading speed

The ideal is to be able to read at **different** speeds and to know which is **appropriate**.
Most books have material that ought to be read **quickly** and material that ought to be read **very slowly**.

To read faster avoid sub-vocalization, **regression**, and fixation; the mind can grasp a sentence with a **glance**.
So practice guiding your reading with your thumb an first two fingers, sweeping them faster than it is **confortable** to read.
Thus you will also avoid **mind wandering**.

<q>Every book should be read no mre slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension</q>

## Marking a book

- Underlining major points.
- Vertical lines at the margin.
- Stars/fold corners to emphasize ten most imporant statements.
- Numbers in the margin to indicate points in developing an argument.
- Numbers of other pages to ndicate where the same point is made. Or points relevant to the one made.
- Record questions (and answers) of passages.

## Quotes

<q>The difference between good and bad stories having the same essential plot
lies in what the author does with it, how he dresses up the bare bones</q>


<q> Reading a book on any level beyond the elementary is essentially an effort on your part to
asl it questions(and to asnwer them to the best of your ability). That should never be forgotten. And that is why there is all the difference in
the world between the demanding and the undemanding reader. The latter ask no questions - and gets no answers.</q>

<q>The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.</q>

<q>The art as something that can be taught consists of rules to be follows in operation. The art as something to be leaned and possesed consists of the habit
that results from operating according to the rules</q>

<q>To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from know _what is the case_
to knowing _what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere_</q>

<q>There are few authors who execute their plan perfectly, but there is often more plan in a good book than meets the eye at first. The surface
can be deceiving. You must look beneath it to discover the real structure.</q>

<q> The reader tries to uncover the skeleton that the book conceals. The author starts with the skeleton and tries to cover it up. His aim is to conceal the skeleton artistcally or, in toher words, to put flesh on the bare bones.</q>

<q>Read not to conrtadict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider</q>

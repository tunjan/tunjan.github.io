        <h1>On living a life determined by fear.</h1>
<p>While reading &quot;You are not a rock&quot; by Mark Freeman. The realization that many of the decisions taken in daily life do not come from a place of enjoyment and
happiness, but from fear and anxiety became obvious. The most understandable examples are those evolving parenting and avoidance of criticism. Why do parents call their children on the phone while they are away? Why do we feel so compelled not to wear stained clothes? But when the stain is there by design, we do like it?.
It would certainly be nice if parents cared about children because they like talking to them and assisting them. Yet not the less, most call by fear of not knowing what their child is doing. And we mostly get well dressed and iron our clothes not because we like them more that way. But because we fear other people judging us.</p>

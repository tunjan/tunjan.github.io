Because of my love for science and finding evidence-based explanations to natural phenomena, I have placed a great focus during my educational years of university on grasping the fundamental laws of physics up to special relativity. I consider myself fortunate to have had professors who taught the field with the self-evident enthusiasm of a curious mind. Books I used to achieve the understanding were "Physics for Scientis and Engineers".

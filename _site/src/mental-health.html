        <h1>Information learned from the book &quot;You are not a Rock&quot; by Mark Freeman</h1>
<h3>Summary in one sentence</h3>
<p>Guide your actions through values, not on feelings to avoid.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p><q>You can pour the rest of your life into trying not to be anxious and trying to prevent your worries from coming true, 
and all you'll have done is focused your energy on things that did't even happen and you didn't even want to think about</q></p>
<p><q>If you hand over control of your value to others, expect them to waste it. They won't know you've put them in charge of the only thing you own.</q></p>
<p><q> When you are caught up in the practice of mindlessness, death becomes very frightening because you are actually aware of moving close
and closer to the end of the life you could have had </q></p>
<p><q> The more you control, the more you must control </q></p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental health</strong> : learning to handle feelings you do not like, while taking action in alignment with your values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compulsion</strong> : anything you do to cope with, chek on, or control uncertainty, anxiety and other feelings you don't like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mindfulnes</strong> : the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment-non-judgmentally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controling</strong> : trying to prevent experiences we do not like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACT</strong> : <em>Accept</em> your reactions and be present. <em>Choose</em> a valued direction. <em>Take</em> action. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive defusion</strong> : therapy to recognize the stuff in your head is stuff you experience. Not you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>The mind can pay attention at one thing at a time. Choose that 'one thing' wisely.</p>
<p>Meditation, to experience thoughts without judgment or attachment, but curiosity.</p>
<p>Worse mental health investing your time into trivial things.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: How would I define myself based on the actions done today?</p>
<p>Compulsions arise good feelings, teaching brain feel bad to feel good.</p>
<p>Actions, separate from thoughts and emotions, act according to values while experiencing thoughts.</p>
<p>Checking compulsions train your brain to find more uncertainties.</p>
<p>If needed to check to feel safe. A prerequisite for feeling safe is feeling unsafe.</p>
<p>Do not stop using X to avoid compulsions, use it as you would like to use it.</p>
<p>You do not have to answer every preocupation the brain throws at you.</p>
<p>If you are present while doing things, the necessity to check dissapears.</p>
<p>Your brain might throw thoughts or judgements to you, recognize that and act as you value. Your thoughts are not you, you cannot control them.</p>
<p>Introduce fantasy elements in your thoughts to be aware of their discrepancy with reality.</p>
<p>It is normal to experience physical symptoms after withdrawing from a compulsion.</p>
<p>When living life based off your values, there is a constant need to ask constantly how you are creating your life.</p>
<p>When making decisions regarding values, the benefits of saying no become much clearer.</p>
<p>Dress as an expression of myself, not as an attempt to avoid fears or control over other people. (we identify by what we buy)</p>
<p>You may see your past as happy, but remember that your past habits are what lead you to this point.</p>
<p>It is not that you do not have time, but that you spend it on things you do not care about deeply.</p>

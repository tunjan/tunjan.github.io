        <h1>Guidelines on reading to understand.</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reading is an active practice</li>
<li>Reading: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter.
and with no helo from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations.</li>
<li>Goal: to pass from understading less to understanding more.</li>
<li>Distinguish between reading for information and reading for understanding</li>
<li>Learning is not remembering more information.</li>
<li>Initial inequality in understanding: the write must understand btter than the reader.</li>
<li>The reader must be able to overcome the inequality.</li>
<li>You have to know what an author says and why he says it.</li>
<li>Reading is like learning from an absent teacher.</li>
<li>Learning to read is at least as complex as learning to ski. Have patience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On reading speed.</h2>
<p>The ideal is note merely to be able to read faster, but to ve able to read at differents speeds. And to know which is appropriate.
Every book , no matter how difficult conttains intersticial material that can be and should be read quickly;and every good book also contains matter that is difficult and should be read very slowly.</p>
<p>Untrained readers: sub-vocalize, fix five or six times in the course of each line tht is read. The eyes regress as often as once every two or three lines.</p>
<p>The mind can grasp a sentence at a &quot;Glance&quot;</p>
<p>Correct fixations and regressions.</p>
<p>Place your thumb and first two fingers together. Sewwp this pointer a little faster than it is confortable. Force youself to keep up with your hand.
Keep increasing the speed at which you sweep.</p>
<p>It is harder to wander in your mind if using the hand.</p>
<p>The problem of speed reading is the problem of comprehension. For comprehension analytical readingis needed.</p>
<h2>Demanding reader</h2>
<p>Ask questions while you read. Questions you youself must try to answer</p>
<p>Four main questions (to ask of all books):</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the book as a whole? (theme of the book how the author develops the theme by subdividing it)</li>
<li>What is being said in detail and how? (main ideas, assertions, arguments of message)</li>
<li>Is the book true, in whole or in part? (after answering the first two)</li>
<li>What of it? (ask about significacne. Why does the author think it imporant to know these things? Is it imporant for you to know them? What is further implied or suggested?)</li>
</ol>
<p>These wuestions are the obligation of a reader. They apply to anything worth reading. They apply to anything worth reading.</p>
<p>Analytical reading is completed when you can answer all of them.</p>
<p>Ask the questions as you read. Answer them precisely and accurately.</p>
<p>Write in the book</p>
<p>Reading is a convesation between you and the author. He knows more than you do.</p>
<p>The worst fault of the non-demandng reader is his inatenttion to words, and failure to come to terms with the author.</p>
<h3>Marking a book</h3>
<ul>
<li>Underlining major points.</li>
<li>Vertical lines at the margin.</li>
<li>Stars to emphasize ten most imporant statements. (fold corner)</li>
<li>Numbers in the margin. to indeicate points in developing an argument.</li>
<li>Numbers of other pages. Indicate where the same point is made. Or points relevant to the one made.(use &quot;Cf&quot;)</li>
<li>Record questions (and answers) of passages. to reduce a complex discussion to a statement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of note-taking</h3>
<ul>
<li>structural (inspectional)</li>
<li>conceptual (analytical)</li>
<li>dialectical (syntopical)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p><q>The difference between good and bad stories having the same essential plot
lies in what the author does with it, how he dresses up the bare bones</q></p>
<p><q>Some books are to be tasted,
others to be swallowed,
and some to to be chewed and digested</q></p>
<p><q>Do not try to understand every word or page of a difficult book the first time through.
This is the most imporant rule of all; it is the essence of inspectional reading. Do not be afraid
to be, or seem to be, superficial. Race through even the hardest book. You will then be prepared
to read it well the second time.</q></p>
<p><q> Reading a book on any level beyond the elementary is essentially an effort on your part to
asl it questions(and to asnwer them to the best of your ability). That should never be forgotten. And that is why there is all the difference in
the world between the demanding and the undemanding reader. The latter ask no questions - and gets no answers.</q></p>
<p><q>The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.</q></p>
<p><q>Marking a book s literally an expression of your differences or your agreemtns with the author. It is the ighest respect you can pay him.</q></p>
<p><q>The art as something that can be taught consists of rules to be follows in operation. The art as something to be leaned and possesed consists of the habit
that results from operating according to the rules</q></p>
<p><q> To forget the acts as separate, you have to learn them first as separate acts.</q></p>
<p><q>To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from know <em>what is the case</em>
to knowing <em>what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere</em></q></p>
<h2>Types of books</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expository: history, science, philosophy</li>
<li>Fictional: novels, poems...</li>
</ul>
<h2>Levels</h2>
<p>Reading can be divided into four levels, the higher the level, the more effort is required. The higher levels require mastery in the lower ones to work.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Elementary</strong>: Understanding words and sentences. Having literacy. Recognizing word on a page.</li>
<li><strong>Inspectional</strong>: Skimming systematically to know the surface of the book and determine if its worth reading. </li>
<li><strong>Analytical</strong>: To chew and digest the book. Asking as many organized questions as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Syntopical</strong>: Reading many books of the same subject and placing them in relation to one another. Very great benefits.</li>
</ol>
<p><q> Every book should be read no mre slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension </q></p>
<h2>Inspectional</h2>
<p>You can learn a lot about the book even if you decide not to read it again with more care.</p>
<p>Preparations for analytycal reading.</p>
<p>Make notes concerning the quesitons. Concerning the structure of the book, not its substance.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Read steadily, without stumbling on grammar or syntax and meanings.</p>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>You do not know wether to read the book. Analytically.</li>
<li>You have limited time to find it out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>What kind of book is it?</p>
<p>What is the book about as a whole?</p>
<p>What is the structure of the book?</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>It can be divided into two steps: <strong>Pre-reading</strong> and <strong>Superficial reading</strong>.</p>
<p>Experienced readers can perform it simultaneously.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-reading</li>
</ul>
<p>You are a detective looking for the books general theme or idea.
1. Look the <strong>title</strong> &amp; <strong>preface</strong> 
2. Study <strong>table of contents</strong> 
3. Check <strong>index</strong>. Read passages with crucial terms. Estimate topics covered.
4. Read <strong>publisher's blurb</strong> and decide if worth to read.
5. Find pivotal <strong>chapters</strong> to the arguments. Read chapters summaries carefully.
6. Turn to <strong>random</strong> pages, reading a paragraph or two. Read the last two or three pages.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: read the last two or three pages.<br>
<strong>Result</strong>: determine if it's worth reading &amp; priming your brain. Anticipates the comprehension of a book's structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Superficial reading: 
<ul>
<li>Necessary for the interpretation of a book's content.</li>
<li>Read it the first time without stopping on look-ups or pondering on things.</li>
<li>Concentrate on things you can understand</li>
<li>Take notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><q>In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it trough without ever stopping to look-up or ponder the things you do not understand</q></p>
<h2>Classifications of books</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fiction</p>
<ul>
<li>Novels</li>
<li>Plays</li>
<li>Lyrics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expository</p>
<ul>
<li>History</li>
<li>Philsophy</li>
<li>Science &amp; Maths</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analytical</h2>
<p>Not necessary if reading for information or entertainment. Only for understanding.</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<h4>First stage (answer first question)</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must know what kind of book you are reading. Fiction (novel, play, epic, lyrics). Expository work(opinions, theories, hypothesis or speculations with the calim made explicitly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence (or short paragraph), &quot;The whole book is about so and so and such and such&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set forth the major parts of the book, and how these are organized into a whole by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole. 
Find the plan behing the book. The best books have the most intelegible structure, but are more complex. Outline the parts of a book and how they exemplify the main theme.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The author accomplished his plan in five major parts pf whih the first is so and so, the second about such and such... The first major part is divided in three sections of which the first considers X the second Y and the third Z. In the first section of the firt part the author makes four points. The first is A, the second B...</p>
<p>Only needed an aproximation of this. And does not need to be done explicitly, but while reading the book if you are experienced. Only appply this rule very well with few books. With others a rough notion is fine. No book deserves a perfect outline. Basically divide the book in parts and the</p>
<p><q>There are few authors who execute their plan perfectly, but there is often more plan in a good book than meets the eye at first. The surface
can be deceiving. You must look beneath it to discover the real structure.</q></p>
<p><q> The reader tries to uncover the skeleton that the book conceals. The author starts with the skeleton and tries to cover it up. His aim is to conceal the skeleton artistcally or, in toher words, to put flesh on the bare bones.</q></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Find out what the author's probems where. The author of a book starts with a question</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be able to state the main questions that the book tries to answer, and divide it into subquestions if the first is too complex.</p>
<h4>Second stage</h4>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Find the important words and thorugh them come to terms with the author.
Locate important words, determine the meaning of those words, as used, with precision.
The most important words are those thta give you trouble.
Sometimes authors tell you how they use a particular word. It is important.
Important: mark the words you do not understand. Bery important.
Coming to terms: use a given word with the same meaning as the writer.
Discover the meaning of a word by using the meaning in contexts you do understand.
If a book gives you insights it may have words you do not understand.
In good books the terms are welll made and put together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark the most imporant sentences and the prMark the most imporant sentences and the propositions it containts</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>propositions are nothing but expression of opinion unless supported by reasons.</p>
<h3>Questions to ask</h3>
<ol>
<li>What is the book as a whole?</li>
<li>What is being said in detail?</li>
<li>Is the book true, in whole or part?</li>
<li>What of it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Reading any book beyond the elementary level requires the reader to ask questions and answer them to the best of his ability.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use you hand to guide your reading speed.</li>
<li>To know when each reading speed is appropriate is the ideoal.</li>

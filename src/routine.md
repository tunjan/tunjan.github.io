A typical day starts at 0630. I make myself a green tea while I have a cold shower. Then I meditate for 45 minutes.
Right after that I decide how that day will be spent. Normally not more than 2 tasks are planned in a morning, which last from 0800 until 1200.
At 1200 I have lunch, which usually is 30 minutes cooking and 30 minutes mindufully eating, and then have a walk. At 1400 resume the task and  t 1600 have a snack. At 1930 dinner. At 2200 I go to sleep with a book after having journaled the day for a half hour.

The evenings are spent doing less mentally demanding tasks. Such as editing this wiki, reading, planning foods or spending time with people.

# Information learned from the book "You are not a Rock" by Mark Freeman

### Summary in one sentence

Guide your actions through values, not on feelings to avoid.

<q>You can pour the rest of your life into trying not to be anxious and trying to prevent your
worries from coming true, and all you'll have done is focused your energy on things that did't even happen and you didn't even want to think about</q>

## Definitions

- **Mental health** : learning to handle feelings you do not like, while taking action in alignment with your values.

- **Compulsion** : anything you do to cope with, chek on, or control uncertainty, anxiety and other feelings you don't like.

- **Mindfulnes** : the awareness that arises through paying attention on purpose in the present moment-non-judgmentally.

- **Controling** : trying to prevent experiences we do not like.

- **ACT** : _Accept_ your reactions and be present. _Choose_ a valued direction. _Take_ action. 

<q> When you are caught up in the practice of mindlessness, death becomes very frightening because you are actually aware of moving close
and closer to the end of the life you could have had </q>

## Reflections

Our minds can only pay attention to one thing at a time. When we are focused on our thoughts, all our brain capacity is focused on that thought.o

Meditation helps to experience thoughts and emotions without judgment, without feeling attached to those, and exploring them with enthusiasm.

To worse your mental health invest your time and energy into things that do not matter to you.

When in doubt if you are spending your time in the right way, ask yourself: How would someone define you based on the actions you carried out today?

If you engage in a compulsion that makes you feels good whenever a bad state arises, you are teaching your brain to feel bad in order to feel good.

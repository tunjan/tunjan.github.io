# Guidelines on reading to understand.

The lessons are derived from the book "How to read a Book"
 
## Levels

 Reading can be divided into four levels, the higher the level, the more effort is required. The higher levels require mastery in the lower ones to work.

 1. **Elementary**: Understanding words and sentences.
 2. **Inspectional**: Skimming systematically to know the surface of the book and determine if its worth reading. 
 3. **Analytical**: To chew and digest the book. Asking as many organized questions as possible.  
 4. **Syntopical**: Reading many books of the same subject and placing them in relation to one another. 

<q> Every book should be read no mre slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension </q>

### Inspectional

It can be divided into two steps: **Pre-reading** and **Superficial reading** 

1. Pre-reading:
    1. Look the **preface** 
    2. Study **table of contents** 
    3. Check **index**
    4. Read **publisher's blurb**
    5. Find important **chapters**
    6. Turn to **random** pages, reading a paragraph or two.

**Important**: read the last two or three pages.<br>
**Result**: determine if it's worth reading.

2. Superficial reading: Read it without stopping on look-ups

<q>In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it trough without ever stopping to look-up or ponder the things you do not understand</q>

### Questions to ask

1. What is the book as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it?

Reading any book beyond the elementary level requires the reader to ask questions and answer them to the best of his ability.:w

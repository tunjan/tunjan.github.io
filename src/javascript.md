## Notes

- Use // comments.

- Inside ${} in a template literal, result will be computed and converted to a string.

- A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.

- The value of an empty binding is undefined.

- Functions do not follow top-to-bottom flow. They can be used in all the same scope.

- Extra arguments in functions get ignored. Arguments not passed get signed 'undefined'.

<li>Time: don't forget that someday death will come, and all you have done will count for nothing.</li>
<li>Compassion: do onto others as you would have them do unto you.</li>
<li>Learning: the body decays after a certain age. The mind (hopefuly) only grows until the end.</li>
<li>Curiosity: learn to understand why things are the way they are.</li>
<li>Reflection: re-value the actions you took in the past to learn from them.</li>
<li>Simplicity: avoid unnecesary complexity.</li>
<li>Humility: be willing to learn from others and accept your shortcomings.</li>
<li>Humanity: the acceptance that I am a homo sapiens, and as such I have limits and needs. Those needs have to be satisfied for the enhancement of my existance and to increase the worth of my life. (i.e: friendship, love, socialization, nutrition).</li>
<li>Hopefulness: to learn to not give up and be defeated on things worth achieving. Friendship, equality, freedom, justice. And to know that even if I have failed everytime it does not mean that I will fail the next.</li>
<li>Skepticism: always inspect one layer down into the nature of things. Don't take things at face value with the easiest explanation.</li>
<li>Equality: all humans and non-human animals deserve to have the same consideration of interests based on their ability to consciously experience life.</li>
<li>Politics: that modern society opinions are mostly influenced by the interest of capitalism.</li>
</ul>

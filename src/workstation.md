The workstation is a laptop inherited from my sister. She bought a new one because the current one could not keep up with Microsoft **Windows** updates and was getting too slow. Thus, I replaced the operating system with Arch **Linux**. Since then, I have been using it for 3 years as a daily driver. 

May this case serve to demonstrate how big tech companies keep producing bad software, causing the need for the common citizen to keep upgrading their electronics unnecessarily, producing endless waste.

These are reflections on my own experience.

- You may not know what you like but at least you know what you do not like.
- The less things you have, the less you have to worry about losing or storing them.
- Staying more than 3 hours in front of a computer device makes me lose perspective on important matters. 
- Working by pomodoros increases efficiency.
- To write unicode characters press Ctrl+Shift+U+(Code)
- Your character is not defined by what you buy.
- Meditation helps to know thyself.

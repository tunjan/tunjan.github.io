        <h1>Volunteering in Animal Shelter</h1>
<p>In the summer of 2022, 32 days were spent doing a volunteering in Moldova.
This is an account of the journey, which I dare say to have enjoyed despite the circumstances.
Which by many are said to have been too dangerous as to adventure into travel. Nonetheless, I did not wish
to be coerced by fear, as most civilized society is kept to-day.</p>
<h2>Why I decided to go</h2>
<p>It must be said, in spite of the loss of audacity. That it was not in my interest to go into such a place
which had a war recently started by a neighbour country. However, given the circumstances in which I found
myself to be at the time of decision, Moldova offered me the easiest approval to initiate an adventure.</p>
<p>If I had not found myself discontented with my current life-style and feeling that it was not life that I was living,
it would have been dubious for me to have undertaken such a journey in order to drastically ditch the means by which I used to sustain.
Thus, I owe to Thoreau, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius the courage and wisdom they passed onto me by as many words as endeavors 
they took during their own lifetimes.</p>
<p>Many close affairs of mine have taken the trouble to warn against the possible outcomes of this journey, though
they did not understand that it was their own outcome which I desired to avoid. To live a life of simplicity, solitude and
meagerness was a experiment that I should try. And then conclude if all the luxury that people pursue and toil their hands for,
mindlessly filling their busy lives, was worth the trouble to get. For I do not mean to work more than I should, and even less
for the wrong kind of pursuit, as it seems that common citizens do.</p>
<p>To find pleasure and meaning in the coarsest and most natural things of existence was a pleasure in itself. I did not find myself in need of a shower unless my armpits had drops in it. And when I did, cold water was there to remember the focus on breathing. 
Three t-shirts for a whole month sufficed me as much as one. For one does not need what one does not have. 
Or am I so fool as to forget what I have while seeking what is not mine?.</p>
<h2>Where I lived &amp; How I lived</h2>
<p>The shelter was located 30 km east of Chisinau city, and the road leading there was filled with forests that [enter text here].
The structure of the place could be described as having an entrance in the west. To the right there was a place where there was a kitchen, a laundry machine and cages with about 80 dogs. </p>
<p>The kitchen was about 4 m<sup>2</sup> and always filled with flies, because the workers left their food open on the dinning table. How unpleasant was to share my meals with those insects, which might have touched feces. Every appliance had rust in it and the drawers had no order. In fact in them there were usually sausages with flies all over them. In the fridge I was alloted a little space in which I saved fruits and beans, because the food provided to me were rice, buckwheat, tomatoes and bread. Which for two weeks make a cheerful diet, but I did not wish to be nutritionally deficient for a month. And so I had to recurrently go to the supermarket each week to buy myself some fruits, berries and nuts which are so important for good health. I had my dinner at 2000 and breakfast at about 1200 so I could fast for 16 hours before taking 'The Old Dog' called Diedo for a walk. I must emphasize that they were not pleasant meals, not only because of the flies, but because of the workers shouting at the dogs. You could not find a peaceful instant within them.</p>
<p>On the left side of the entrance there were 3 different areas for the dogs to play around so they could leave their cages for sometime everyday. I would rather be dead than living in those cages with so much bark noise, the dogs there must get mad, not only because of the narrow space they are given, but the way they are treated by the workers too.</p>
<p>Following straight on from the entrance for 200 meters, at the right there was a kind of house, which had two floors and a patio eith around 50 dogs caged. In the first floor were 2 dorms, and a bathroom for dogs, which I employed to have a shower. The second floor was a house for cats and two injured puppies, whom I had to take out for play everyday. Outside the house was a toilet which was basically a hole in the ground with the ceramics to place your ass in it. At the left there was a patio for more dogs to play in.</p>
<p>Following straight on from the entrance for 400 meters to the left was my dwelling. It consisted of a little cabin of two rooms. One of the rooms was for 10 puppies that lived with me. And the other was for myself. The space I was given was very good. However, I cannot say the same for the puppies that had to sleep in the same room. Notice here that for me to go to the bathroom there was a walk of 200 meters populated by dogs which barked at you non-cessantly. Outside of the cabin there was a patio that had two cages, one for 4 big puppies, and the other for one blind dog called Viktor. I had to alternate their time between going out and satying inside th house because the big ones could not play with the small ones. My room was very cozy. I had a wooden table that was no taller than my kness (about 50 cm). And a bed which was very uncomfy. The puppies woke me up at 0630 everyday, and so had to leave my bed, cage-in Viktor (because he is blind and goes out in the night). And then leave the puppies out. The fact of waking up with ten little dogs barking and crying was one of the worst things of beign here. How much I missed a peaceful wake up.</p>
<p>Everyday I had to change their beds, wipe the floor, change their blankets, and put new hay for them to poop and pee. It might be thought to be easy. However, having to walk half a kilometer to go for new blankets and get clean hay was a martir. Moreover, the way to there was filled with barkings from the other dogs.</p>
<p>At the other side of my cabin there was a patio of 100 dogs. Which barked at me even when I was at my room cleaning my teeth.</p>
<p>Most of my daily hours were spent either walking in the forest, or reading and programming in my cabin. I journaled a lot, and got to know a lot more about me. Though I would have liked more interaction with the people living here. But I came for solitude and that was what I got. It was hard to focus on intellectual matters because the dogs did so much noise. That was when I decided to go for a walk at the forest.</p>
<h2>The forest</h2>
<p>Every morning I was compelled to enjoy nature, and so took my legs and thoughts to the forest. How best to spare the
best hours of the day? Nay, the best of existence itself. Being in bed was a waste of time to me when I could be listening
and observing how spiders and birds went by their usual affairs, which I dare say to be much more interesting than that of us humans. The wild take only the present and enjoy it to its fullest, while we spend most of our present tither and hither, fearing the future, clinging to the past. </p>
<p>Not one day had the forest the same colour and sounds as any other.</p>
<h2>The dogs</h2>
<h2>The rats</h2>
<h2>The people</h2>
<p>At meal time everyone eats their portion without giving a thought to the means by which it was obtained or cooked,
because they did not engage in the act itself. Oh, how few people would go through the trouble of eating meat if they
were aware of the many flies they attract when dead.</p>
